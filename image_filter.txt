The filteration of an image is done using mean and median filter.
When noise is present in the image, then that image must be filtered out to give a better quality of the image.
The noise in the image processing are Salt and pepper noise, Gaussian noise, Poisson noise and Speckle noise.
In this project, Salt and pepper noise is filtered out from the image.
Salt and pepper noise refers to the white and black spots present in the image.
It is also known as impulsive noise.
Median filter shows the better result for removal of Salt and pepper noise from the image.
Different filters is suitable for different noises.
