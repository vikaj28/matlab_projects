With the current development of communication networks and internet services, the transmission of digital data over the networks has increased vastly.
To provide the security of these digital data, some other data is hided into the original digital data.
The data hiding into the images is a very important technique which is highly used in medical and military applications.
Reversible data hiding is one of the techniques which is used for embedding the data into the digital images.
Reversible data hiding is a technique that provides the secure and systematic embedding of additional information into the original digital data
 like images, audios, videos, etc. and maintain the original digital data and allow the extraction of the hidden data without any distortion.
In this project, Reversible Data Hiding is used for embedding the data into the original image using histogram shifting process is proposed.
For embedding the secret message bits into the original image, from histogram of the original image Peak point is selected and pixel further 
 greater than this peak point is shifted right by 2 units to create vacant places and then these secret message bits of 0s and 1s is inserted 
 into the image and thus embedding process is done. The histogram shifting can also be done by some other units.
For extraction process, from the embedded image secret message bits are extracted and also the original image is recovered back successfully.
While extracting the original image reverse histogram shifting is done i.e. shifting the histogram left by same units as in embedding process.
Multiple test images are implemented using this proposed reversible data hiding techniques and results show the good performance in terms of 
 performance parameters like embedding capacity (payload), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).
